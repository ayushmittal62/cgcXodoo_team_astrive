# Google Maps Integration Setup

## 🗺️ Google Maps Integration Added!

I've successfully integrated Google Maps into your event details page with the following features:

### ✨ Features Added:

1. **Interactive Google Map** 
   - Shows event location with a custom marker
   - Dark theme to match your app's design
   - Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

2. **Direction Options**
   - **"Directions" button** - Opens Google Maps with turn-by-turn directions
   - **"Open in Maps" button** - Opens the location in Google Maps for exploration

3. **Auto-geocoding**
   - Automatically converts event location text to map coordinates
   - Places a custom cyan marker on the event venue

4. **User-friendly Interface**
   - Loading spinner while map loads
   - Clean, modern design matching your app theme
   - Helpful interaction hints for users

### 🔧 Setup Instructions:

#### Step 1: Get Google Maps API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable these APIs:
   - **Maps JavaScript API**
   - **Geocoding API**
4. Create credentials → API Key
5. Copy your API key

#### Step 2: Add API Key to Environment
1. Open `.env.local` file
2. Replace `your_google_maps_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

#### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 🎯 How It Works:

1. **Location Detection**: Automatically uses the `event.location` from your mock data
2. **Geocoding**: Converts location string to coordinates using Google's Geocoding API
3. **Map Rendering**: Displays interactive map with custom styling
4. **Navigation**: Provides direct links to Google Maps for directions

### 🎨 Design Features:

- **Dark Theme**: Custom map styling to match your app's dark theme
- **Custom Marker**: Cyan-colored marker matching your brand colors
- **Responsive Layout**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- **Glass-morphism Card**: Consistent with your existing design language

### 📱 Mobile Experience:

- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive button layout
- Optimized map height for mobile screens
- Smooth scrolling and zooming

### 🚀 Technical Implementation:

- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with custom declarations
- **Async Loading**: Google Maps API loads asynchronously for better performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and loading states
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and reference management

### 🎯 Location Data:

The map automatically uses your event's location data:
- "Downtown Arena, Seattle"
- "Moscone West, San Francisco" 
- "Expo Center, Berlin"

### 🔒 Security:

- Environment variables for API key security
- Proper API key restrictions recommended
- Client-side only implementation

### 🆘 Troubleshooting:

**Map not loading?**
- Check if API key is correct in `.env.local`
- Ensure Maps JavaScript API is enabled
- Check browser console for errors

**Directions not working?**
- Verify the location string in your event data
- Make sure Geocoding API is enabled

**Styling issues?**
- Map uses custom dark theme styling
- All responsive breakpoints are handled

### 🎉 Ready to Use!

Your Google Maps integration is now complete and ready to use! Users can:
- View the exact event location on an interactive map
- Get directions to the venue with one click
- Open the location in their preferred maps app
- Enjoy a seamless, professional experience

Just add your Google Maps API key and you're all set! 🚀
